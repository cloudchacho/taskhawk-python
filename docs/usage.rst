Usage Guide
===========

Tasks
+++++

Add :meth:`taskhawk.task` decorator to convert any unbound function into an async task, as shown here:

.. code:: python

   @taskhawk.task
   def send_email(to: str, subject: str, from_email: str = None) -> None:
       # send email

Optionally, pass in ``priority=taskhawk.Priority.high`` to mark the task as a high priority task.

Task name is automatically inferred from decorated function module and name, but you can also set it
explicitly with ``name`` parameter.

If your task function accepts an kwarg called ``metadata`` (of type ``taskhawk.Metadata``) or ``**kwargs``, the
function will be called with a ``metadata`` parameter with the following attributes:

**headers**: task headers that it was dispatched with. This is an arbitrary dict which may be used to pass, as an
example, request id.

**id**: task identifier. This represents a run of a task.

**provider_metadata**: Platform specific metadata, for example SQS receipt or PubSub ack id. This may be used to
extend message visibility if the task is running longer than expected using ``taskhawk.extend_visibility_timeout``.

**priority**: the priority a task was dispatched with. This will be same as task's priority, unless priority was
customized on dispatch.

**timestamp**: task dispatch epoch timestamp (milliseconds)

**version**: message format version. Currently can only be 1.

If your task function accepts an kwarg called ``headers`` (of type ``dict``) or ``**kwargs``, the function will be
called with a ``headers`` parameter which is dict that the task was dispatched with.

Publisher
+++++++++

You can run tasks asynchronously like so:

.. code:: python

  send_email.dispatch('example@email.com', 'Hello!', from_email='example@spammer.com')

If you want to include a custom headers with the message (for example, you can include a ``request_id`` field for
cross-application tracing), or you want to customize priority, you can customize a particular task invocation using
chaining like so:

.. code:: python

  send_email.with_headers(request_id='1234')\
            .with_priority(taskhawk.Priority.high)\
            .dispatch('example@email.com')

Consumer
++++++++

A consumer for AWS SQS/Google PubSub based workers can be started as following:

.. code:: python

  taskhawk.listen_for_messages(taskhawk.Priority.high)

This is a blocking function, so if you want to listen to multiple priority queues, you'll need to run these on
separate processes (don't use threads since this library is **NOT** guaranteed to be thread-safe).

A consumer for Lambda based workers can be started as following:

.. code:: python

  taskhawk.process_messages_for_lambda_consumer(lambda_event)

where ``lambda_event`` is the event provided by AWS to your Lambda function as described `here
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/eventsources.html#eventsources-sns>`_.

If your tasks exist in different modules, ensure that your modules are imported before calling Taskhawk listener
functions since tasks need to be registered before they can receive messages.

Internals

Message format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Internally, all tasks are converted into a message that looks like this:

.. code:: json

    {
        "id": "b1328174-a21c-43d3-b303-964dfcc76efc",
        "metadata": {
            "priority": "high",
            "timestamp": 1460868253255,
            "version": "1.0"
        },
        "headers": {
            "request_id": "95df01b4-ee98-5cb9-9903-4c221d41eb5e"
        },
        "task": "tasks.send_email",
        "args": [
            "email@automatic.com",
            "Hello!"
        ],
        "kwargs": {
            "from_email": "spam@example.com"
        }
    }
